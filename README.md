📝 Personal Blog Web Application (In-Memory)
A lightweight, server-side rendered blog engine built to demonstrate the fundamentals of Full-Stack Web Development. This project focuses on handling HTTP requests and dynamic content rendering without the overhead of a persistent database.

🚀 Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to create a functional blog platform where users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) posts in a single session. It serves as a practical implementation of:

Middleware Integration: Using Express for routing and static file serving.

Dynamic Templating: Utilizing EJS to inject JavaScript logic into HTML.

State Management: Handling data through an in-memory array structure.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js & Express.js

Frontend: EJS (Embedded JavaScript), CSS3, HTML5

Tooling: Git, GitHub, and NPM

🎓 About the Developer
Education: 2nd Year B.Tech Computer Science student

Academic Standing: 8.17 CGPA

📌 Note on Data Persistence
In this version, blog posts are stored in an array on the server. Because no external database is used, the data will reset whenever the server restarts. This design highlights my ability to manage server-side logic and temporary state.
